## 🗣️ About

The aim of this project is to code a function that returns a line, read from a file descriptor.

For detailed information, refer to the [**subject of this project**](https://github.com/joao-per/42-Get_Next_Line/blob/main/Subject.pdf).

## 🛠️ Download

### Requirements

The library is written in C language and thus needs the **`gcc` compiler** and some standard **C libraries** to run.

### Instructions

```shell
git clone https://github.com/joao-per/42-Get_Next_Line.git
```

### Tester

If you want to use my tester, do 
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -D BUFFER_SIZE=***xxxxx*** get_next_line.c get_next_line_utils.c tester.c && ./a.out
You can also test your bonus but, for that, please decrement 1 in "While" values, so you can see if your get next line can handle multiple files with the correct buffer.
